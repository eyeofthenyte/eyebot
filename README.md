# eyebot

This bot is a personal project just to messaround and see what I can actually do with discord.py and more recently TwitchIO libraries.

Currently some additional libraries I use with it are gsheets or gspread if you wanted.

To run a copy of this bot you will need to make a file called eyebot.cfg with the following lines
```
<Discord Bot Secret>
<Bot Prefix>
<Twitch OAuth Token>
<Twitch Client ID>
<Twitch Client Secret>
<Twitch Bot Nickname>
<Twitch Channels> <-multiple channels separated by commas
```

Additional files will be ones related to the gsheets and gspread libraries to authenticate the connection to your account.
