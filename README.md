# eyebot

This bot is a personal project just to messaround and see what I can actually do with discord.py and more recently TwitchIO libraries.

Currently some additional libraries I use with it are gsheets or gspread if you wanted.

To run a copy of this bot you will need to copy the config.yaml.dist file to config.yaml and install `pip install pyyaml`

Additional files will be ones related to the gsheets and gspread libraries to authenticate the connection to your account.
